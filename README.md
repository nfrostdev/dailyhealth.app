An online daily mental healthcare checklist.

## Development Requirements

* [Hugo 0.80+ Extended](https://gohugo.io/)
* [Node.js 14.16.1+](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Setting up Local Development
After you have the appropriate runtimes installed, navigate to the directory you cloned this repository and install NPM dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```

After NPM dependencies are installed, you can run a local development server with Hugo in that same directory.
```bash
hugo server
```
If building fails, you likely have not installed the Hugo extended version, it is required for SCSS compilation.
